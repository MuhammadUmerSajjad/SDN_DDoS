# SDN_DDoS

# This project is about detecting and mitigating the effects of DDoS attacks on SDN networks

# We used POX as an SDN controller and Mininet to emulate the network

# We generated large amount of SYN flood packets which demonstrate the Distributed DoS attack behaviour and targeted those to
# a server in our network.

# Used packets per second as a metric to detect DoS attacks and added a flow in the network to block the users generating the attacks
